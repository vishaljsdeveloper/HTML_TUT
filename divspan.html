<!--div and span are used to create the layout and structure of a webite . it is the most
important topic in html. div is the most important
div= block element
span=inline element
these two are the wrapper of all other elements/tags
div= div is a block-level element :always start on a new line and takes up the full width
available(stretches out to the left and right as far as it can untill and unless you use the style to
make it small)
note- all elements in html are either block level or inline
inline element: an inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much 
width(depend on the content within) as necessary.-->
